	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lack of standardized disability progression evaluation in multiple sclerosis (MS) hinders reproducibility of clinical study results, due to heterogeneous and poorly reported criteria. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the impact of using different parameters when evaluating MS progression, and to introduce an automated tool for reproducible outcome computation. METHODS: Re-analyzing BRAVO clinical trial data (NCT00605215), we examined the fluctuations in computed treatment effect on confirmed disability progression (CDP) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) when varying different parameters. These analyses were conducted using the msprog package for R, which we developed as a tool for CDP assessment from longitudinal data, given a set of criteria that can be specified by the user. RESULTS: The BRAVO study reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-1.02) for CDP. Using the different parameter configurations, the resulting treatment effect on CDP varied considerably, with HRs ranging from 0.59 (95% CI: 0.41-0.86) to 0.72 (95% CI: 0.48-1.07). The treatment effect on PIRA varied from an HR = 0.62 (95% CI: 0.41-0.93) to an HR = 0.65 (95% CI: 0.40-1.04). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of an open-access tool validated by the research community, with clear parameter specification and standardized output, could greatly reduce heterogeneity in CDP estimation and promote repeatability of study results.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: B cells influence the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes CD20+ B cells. METHODS: In two identical phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned 821 and 835 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis to receive intravenous ocrelizumab at a dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a at a dose of 44 Î¼g three times weekly for 96 weeks. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate. RESULTS: The annualized relapse rate was lower with ocrelizumab than with interferon beta-1a in trial 1 (0.16 vs. 0.29; 46% lower rate with ocrelizumab; P<0.001) and in trial 2 (0.16 vs. 0.29; 47% lower rate; P<0.001). In prespecified pooled analyses, the percentage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks was significantly lower with ocrelizumab than with interferon beta-1a (9.1% vs. 13.6%; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.81; P<0.001), as was the percentage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 24 weeks (6.9% vs. 10.5%; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.84; P=0.003). The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance scan was 0.02 with ocrelizumab versus 0.29 with interferon beta-1a in trial 1 (94% lower number of lesions with ocrelizumab, P<0.001) and 0.02 versus 0.42 in trial 2 (95% lower number of lesions, P<0.001). The change in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score (a composite measure of walking speed, upper-limb movements, and cognition; for this z score, negative values indicate worsening and positive values indicate improvement) significantly favored ocrelizumab over interferon beta-1a in trial 2 (0.28 vs. 0.17, P=0.004) but not in trial 1 (0.21 vs. 0.17, P=0.33). Infusion-related reactions occurred in 34.3% of the patients treated with ocrelizumab. Serious infection occurred in 1.3% of the patients treated with ocrelizumab and in 2.9% of those treated with interferon beta-1a. Neoplasms occurred in 0.5% of the patients treated with ocrelizumab and in 0.2% of those treated with interferon beta-1a. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ocrelizumab was associated with lower rates of disease activity and progression than interferon beta-1a over a period of 96 weeks. Larger and longer studies of the safety of ocrelizumab are required. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche; OPERA I and II ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01247324 and NCT01412333 , respectively.).},

	Abstract = {{The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration and brain atrophy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) are not completely understood.To determine whether disability progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in patients with RMS is associated with accelerated brain tissue loss.In this observational, longitudinal cohort study with median (IQR) follow-up of 3.2 years (2.0-4.9), data were acquired from January 2012 to September 2019 in a consortium of tertiary university and nonuniversity referral hospitals. Patients were included if they had regular clinical follow-up and at least 2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans suitable for volumetric analysis. Data were analyzed between January 2020 and March 2021.According to the clinical evolution during the entire observation, patients were classified as those presenting (1) relapse activity only, (2) PIRA episodes only, (3) mixed activity, or (4) clinical stability.Mean difference in annual percentage change (MD-APC) in brain volume/cortical thickness between groups, calculated after propensity score matching. Brain atrophy rates, and their association with the variables of interest, were explored with linear mixed-effect models.Included were 1904 brain MRI scans from 516 patients with RMS (67.4\\% female; mean [SD] age, 41.4 [11.1] years; median [IQR] Expanded Disability Status Scale score, 2.0 [1.5-3.0]). Scans with insufficient quality were excluded (nâ=â19). Radiological inflammatory activity was associated with increased atrophy rates in several brain compartments, while an increased annualized relapse rate was linked to accelerated deep gray matter (GM) volume loss. When compared with clinically stable patients, patients with PIRA had an increased rate of brain volume loss (MD-APC, â0.36; 95\\% CI, â0.60 to â0.12; Pâ=â.02), mainly driven by GM loss in the cerebral cortex. Patients who were relapsing presented increased whole brain atrophy (MD-APC, â0.18; 95\\% CI, â0.34 to â0.02; Pâ=â.04) with respect to clinically stable patients, with accelerated GM loss in both cerebral cortex and deep GM. No differences in brain atrophy rates were measured between patients with PIRA and those presenting relapse activity.Our study shows that patients with RMS and PIRA exhibit accelerated brain atrophy, especially in the cerebral cortex. These results point to the need to recognize the insidious manifestations of PIRA in clinical practice and to further evaluate treatment strategies for patients with PIRA in clinical trials.}},

@article{kuhlmann2023,
	Abstract = {Traditionally, multiple sclerosis has been categorised by distinct clinical descriptors-relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive-for patient care, research, and regulatory approval of medications. Accumulating evidence suggests that the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is better considered as a continuum, with contributions from concurrent pathophysiological processes that vary across individuals and over time. The apparent evolution to a progressive course reflects a partial shift from predominantly localised acute injury to widespread inflammation and neurodegeneration, coupled with failure of compensatory mechanisms, such as neuroplasticity and remyelination. Ageing increases neural susceptibility to injury and decreases resilience. These observations encourage a new consideration of the course of multiple sclerosis as a spectrum defined by the relative contributions of overlapping pathological and reparative or compensatory processes. New understanding of key mechanisms underlying progression and measures to quantify progressive pathology will potentially have important and beneficial implications for clinical care, treatment targets, and regulatory decision-making.},

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Emerging evidence suggests that progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) is a substantial contributor to long-term disability accumulation in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). To date, there is no uniform agreed-upon definition of PIRA, limiting the comparability of published studies. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current evidence about PIRA based on a systematic review, to discuss the various terminologies used in the context of PIRA, and to propose a harmonized definition for PIRA for use in clinical practice and future trials. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A literature search was conducted using the search terms multiple sclerosis, PIRA, progression independent of relapse activity, silent progression, and progression unrelated to relapses in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, published between January 1990 and December 2022. FINDINGS: Of 119 identified single records, 48 eligible studies were analyzed. PIRA was reported to occur in roughly 5% of all patients with RRMS per annum, causing at least 50% of all disability accrual events in typical RRMS. The proportion of PIRA vs relapse-associated worsening increased with age, longer disease duration, and, despite lower absolute event numbers, potent suppression of relapses by highly effective disease-modifying therapy. However, different studies used various definitions of PIRA, rendering the comparability of studies difficult. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: PIRA is the most frequent manifestation of disability accumulation across the full spectrum of traditional MS phenotypes, including clinically isolated syndrome and early RRMS. The harmonized definition suggested here may improve the comparability of results in current and future cohorts and data sets.},

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Accumulation of disability in multiple sclerosis may occur as relapse-associated worsening (RAW) or steady progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA), with PIRA regarded as a feature of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contributions of relapse-associated worsening vs relapse-independent progression to overall confirmed disability accumulation (CDA) and assess respective baseline prognostic factors and outcomes of 2 treatments. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analyses occurred from July 2015 to February 2020 on pooled data from the intention-to-treat population of 2 identical, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group randomized clinical trials (OPERA I and II) conducted between August 2011 and April 2015. In the trials, patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), diagnosed using the 2010 revised McDonald criteria, were randomized from 307 trial sites in 56 countries; resulting data were analyzed in the pooled data set. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 600 mg of ocrelizumab by intravenous infusion every 24 weeks or subcutaneous interferon Î²-1a 3 times a week at a dose of 44 Î¼g throughout a 96-week treatment period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Confirmed disability accumulation was defined by an increase in 1 or more of 3 measures (Expanded Disability Status Scale, timed 25-ft walk, or 9-hole peg test), confirmed after 3 or 6 months, and classified per temporal association with confirmed clinical relapses (PIRA or RAW). RESULTS: In the pooled OPERA I and II population (1656 of 2096 eligible participants), baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar for patients randomized to interferon Î²-1a vs ocrelizumab (mean [SD] age, 37.2 [9.2] vs 37.1 [9.2] years; 552 [66.6%] vs 541 women [65.4%]). After 96 weeks, 12-week composite CDA had occurred in 223 (29.6% by Kaplan-Meier estimate) randomized to interferon Î²-1a and 167 (21.1%) randomized to ocrelizumab; 24-week composite CDA had occurred in 170 (22.7%) taking interferon Î²-1a and 129 (16.2%) taking ocrelizumab. The PIRA events were the main contributors to 12-week and 24-week composite CDA after 96 weeks in patients treated with interferon Î²-1a (174 of 223 [78.0%] and 137 of 170 [80.6%], respectively) and ocrelizumab (147 of 167 [88.0%] and 115 of 129 [89.1%], respectively); a minority had CDA explained by RAW events (69 of 390 [17.7%] and 52 of 299 [17.4%], respectively). Very few patients with composite CDA experienced both RAW and PIRA events (17 of 390 [4.4%] for 12-week and 15 of 299 [5.0%] for 24-week composite CDA). Ocrelizumab (vs interferon Î²-1a) was associated with reduced risk of composite CDA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67) and confirmed PIRA (HR, 0.78) and RAW (HR, 0.47) events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most disability accumulation in RMS is not associated with overt relapses. This indicates an underlying progression in this typical RMS population and challenges the current clinical distinction of relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab was superior to interferon Î²-1a in preventing both RAW and PIRA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: OPERA I (NCT01247324) and OPERA II (NCT01412333).},

	Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a major cause of neurological disability, which accrues predominantly during progressive forms of the disease. Although development of multifocal inflammatory lesions is the underlying pathological process in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the gradual accumulation of disability that characterises progressive multiple sclerosis seems to result more from diffuse immune mechanisms and neurodegeneration. As a result, the 14 anti-inflammatory drugs that have regulatory approval for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have little or no efficacy in progressive multiple sclerosis without inflammatory lesion activity. Effective therapies for progressive multiple sclerosis that prevent worsening, reverse damage, and restore function are a major unmet need. In this Series paper we summarise the current status of therapy for progressive multiple sclerosis and outline prospects for the future.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need for more robust outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials has been a main priority of the field for decades. Dissatisfaction with existing measures has led to several consensus meetings and initiatives over the past few decades in hopes of defining and gaining acceptance of measures that are valid, reliable, sensitive to change and progression, and most importantly, relevant to those living with MS. The Multiple Sclerosis Outcome Assessments Consortium (MSOAC) was formed for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the results of the MSOAC plan to obtain qualification for a cognitive performance measure that meets these requirements. METHODS: Using data from 14 MS disease-modifying registration trials, we completed a comprehensive examination of the psychometric qualities of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) with the goal of compiling evidence to support the utilization of one of these measures in future clinical trials. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Consistent with the published literature, the SDMT proved superior to the PASAT. The SDMT should be considered the measure of choice for MS trials in assessing cognitive processing speed.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) is a key clinical outcome measure in multiple sclerosis patient management and clinical research. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate T25FW performance and factors associated with its change in the Multiple Sclerosis Outcome Assessments Consortium (MSOAC) Placebo Database (n = 2465). METHODS: We created confirmed disability progression (CDP) variables for T25FW and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) outcomes. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland Altman plots to evaluate reliability. We evaluated T25FW changes and predictive validity using a mixed-effects model, survival analysis, and nested case-control analysis. RESULTS: The mean baseline score for the T25FW in this study population was 9.2 seconds, median = 6.1 (standard deviation = 11.0, interquartile range (IQR) = 4.8, 9.0). The T25FW measure demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.98). Walk times increased with age, disability, disease type, and disease duration; relapses were not associated with an increase. Patients with T25FW progression had a faster time to EDSS-CDP compared to those without (hazards ratio (HR): 2.6; confidence interval (CI): 2.2, 3.1). Changes in the T25FW were more likely to precede changes in EDSS. CONCLUSION: This research confirms the association of the T25FW with disability and provides some evidence of predictive validity. Our findings support the continued use of the T25FW in clinical practice and clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {For the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), components of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), cut-off points of 20% change have previously been defined as meaningful endpoints of functional decline. Recently, however, a 15% change of MSFC components was introduced. The objective of this study was to determine optimal cut-offs for all MSFC components to indicate clinical disease progression in a primary progressive (PP) multiple sclerosis (MS) population. T25FW, 9HPT and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were performed in 161 patients with PPMS with a 2-year interval. Absolute and relative differences in test scores were calculated. For each cut-off point of relative change, proportions of patients who progressed (deterioration beyond cut-off value) and improved (improvement beyond cut-off value) were calculated. Further, we calculated the ratio of 'improved' versus 'progressed' patients. Line graphs were created indicating: percentage progressed patients, percentage improved patients, and ratio of improved versus progressed patients. The optimal cut-off was determined by searching the cut-off point with the lowest ratio of improved versus progressed patients, while at the same time capturing a substantial amount of progression. For both T25FW and 9HPT, the ratio between patients that improved and worsened clearly decreased between the cut-offs of 15% and 20%. For the PASAT, the ratio between patients improved and worsened was persistently poor. In conclusion, a cut-off of 20% for both T25FW and 9HPT has a better signal-to-noise ratio than lower values (e.g. 15%) and is therefore preferable for the assessment of disease progression. No satisfactory cut-off point for the PASAT could be determined.},

	Abstract = {A number of studies have been conducted with the onset of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis as an inclusion criterion or an outcome of interest. However, a standardized objective definition of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis has been lacking. The aim of this work was to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of an objective definition for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, to enable comparability of future research studies. Using MSBase, a large, prospectively acquired, global cohort study, we analysed the accuracy of 576 data-derived onset definitions for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and first compared these to a consensus opinion of three neurologists. All definitions were then evaluated against 5-year disease outcomes post-assignment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: sustained disability, subsequent sustained progression, positive disability trajectory, and accumulation of severe disability. The five best performing definitions were further investigated for their timeliness and overall disability burden. A total of 17 356 patients were analysed. The best definition included a 3-strata progression magnitude in the absence of a relapse, confirmed after 3 months within the leading Functional System and required an Expanded Disability Status Scale step â¥4 and pyramidal score â¥2. It reached an accuracy of 87% compared to the consensus diagnosis. Seventy-eight per cent of the identified patients showed a positive disability trajectory and 70% reached significant disability after 5 years. The time until half of all patients were diagnosed was 32.6 years (95% confidence interval 32-33.6) after disease onset compared with the physicians' diagnosis at 36 (35-39) years. The identified patients experienced a greater disease burden [median annualized area under the disability-time curve 4.7 (quartiles 3.6, 6.0)] versus non-progressive patients [1.8 (1.2, 1.9)]. This objective definition of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and information about preceding relapses provides a tool for a reproducible, accurate and timely diagnosis that requires a very short confirmation period. If applied broadly, the definition has the potential to strengthen the design and improve comparability of clinical trials and observational studies in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.},

	Abstract = {Objective Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pretreatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort, more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10th year of follow-up. Notably, ``no evidence of disease activity'' at 2âyears did not predict long-term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long-term disability accumulation. Methods Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0, or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSSâ=â0, 1.0--5.0, and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 ($\pm$1âyear) and sustained to year 10 ($\pm$1âyear). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and HLA-DRB1*15:01 as covariates. Results Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over 1-year intervals (pâ=â0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (pâ=â0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (pâ<â0.05). Interpretation Long-term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is largely independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy.

	Abstract = { Background:Confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression occurring after a fixed-study entry baseline is a common measure of disability increase in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) studies but may not detect all disability progression events, especially those unrelated to overt relapses.Objective:To evaluate possible measures of disability progression unrelated to relapse using EDSS data over â5.5 years from the Tysabri{\textregistered} Observational Program (TOP).Methods:TOP is an ongoing, prospective, open-label study in RRMS patients receiving intravenous 300 mg natalizumab every 4 weeks. Measures of increasing disability were assessed using as a reference either study baseline score or a ``roving'' system that resets the reference score after â©¾24- or â©¾48-week confirmation of a new score.Results:This analysis included 5562 patients. Approximately 70\% more EDSS progression events unrelated to relapse and 50\% more EDSS worsening events overall were detected with a roving reference score (cumulative probability: 17.6\% and 29.7\%, respectively) than with a fixed reference baseline score (cumulative probability: 10.1\% and 20.3\%, respectively).Conclusion:In this long-term observational RRMS dataset, a roving EDSS reference value was more efficient than a study baseline EDSS reference in detecting progression/worsening events unrelated to relapses and thus the transition to secondary progressive disease. },

	Abstract = {Accurate clinical course descriptions (phenotypes) of multiple sclerosis (MS) are important for communication, prognostication, design and recruitment of clinical trials, and treatment decision-making. Standardized descriptions published in 1996 based on a survey of international MS experts provided purely clinical phenotypes based on data and consensus at that time, but imaging and biological correlates were lacking. Increased understanding of MS and its pathology, coupled with general concern that the original descriptors may not adequately reflect more recently identified clinical aspects of the disease, prompted a re-examination of MS disease phenotypes by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS. While imaging and biological markers that might provide objective criteria for separating clinical phenotypes are lacking, we propose refined descriptors that include consideration of disease activity (based on clinical relapse rate and imaging findings) and disease progression. Strategies for future research to better define phenotypes are also outlined.CIS=clinically isolated syndrome; EDSS=Expanded Disability Status Scale; MS=multiple sclerosis; NMSS=National Multiple Sclerosis Society; OCT=optical coherence tomography; PP=primary progressive; PR=progressive relapsing; PRO=patient-reported outcomes; RIS=radiologically isolated syndrome; RR=relapsing-remitting; SP=secondary progressive},
