`msprog` is an R package providing tools for exhaustive and reproducible
analysis of disability course in multiple sclerosis (MS) from
longitudinal data \[[1](#ref-msprog2024)\]. A [**Python
version**](https://github.com/noemimontobbio/pymsprog) of the package is
available as well.

Its core function, `MSprog()`, detects and characterises the evolution
of an outcome measure (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS; Nine-Hole
Peg Test, NHPT; Timed 25-Foot Walk, T25FW; Symbol Digit Modalities Test,
SDMT; or any custom outcome measure) for one or more subjects, based on
repeated assessments through time and on the dates of acute episodes (if
any).

The package also provides two toy datasets for function testing:

- `toydata_visits`: artificially generated EDSS and SDMT assessments for
  a small cohort of patients;
- `toydata_relapses`: artificially generated relapse onset dates
  associated with the patients in `toydata_visits`.

Please refer to the documentation for function usage (e.g.Â `?MSprog`)
and data structure (e.g.Â `?toydata_visits`). The whole documentation can
be found in the [reference manual (PDF)](msprog.pdf). Additionally, a
detailed tutorial providing examples and best-practice tips is available
as a [package vignette](#vignette): *Analysing disability course in MS*.

<!-- The outcome computation can be run locally on any computer with R version $\geq$ 3.5.0 (see installation instructions below), or online via a user-friendly [web application](https://msprog.shinyapps.io/msprog/). -->

**If you use this package in your work, please cite it [as

appreciated!

## Installation

You can install the development version of `msprog` from GitHub by
running the command below. If using RStudio, please make sure to restart
the R session right before running the installation.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("noemimontobbio/msprog", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

## Getting started

The `MSprog()` function detects the events sequentially by scanning the
outcome values in chronological order.

The example below illustrates how to import toy data and apply
`MSprog()` to analyse EDSS course with the default settings.

``` r
library(msprog)

# Load toy data
data(toydata_visits)
data(toydata_relapses)

# Compute disability course
output <- MSprog(toydata_visits,                                      # provide data on visits
                 subj_col='id', value_col='EDSS', date_col='date',    # specify column names
                 outcome='edss',                                      # specify outcome type
                 relapse=toydata_relapses)                            # provide data on relapses
#> 
#> ---
#> Outcome: edss
#> Confirmation over: 84 days (-7 days, +730.5 days)
#> Baseline: fixed
#> Baseline skipped if: <30 days from last relapse
#> Event skipped if: -
#> Confirmation visit skipped if: <30 days from last relapse
#> Events detected: firstCDW
#> 
#> *Please use `print(output)` to display full info on event detection criteria*
#> 
#> ---
#> Total subjects: 6
#> ---
#> Subjects with disability worsening: 3 (PIRA: 2; RAW: 1)
```

Several qualitative and quantitative options for event detection are
given as arguments that can be set by the user and reported as a
complement to the results to ensure reproducibility. For example,
instead of only detecting the first confirmed disability worsening (CDW)
event for each subject, we can detect *all* disability events
sequentially by moving the baseline after each event
(`event='multiple', baseline='roving'`)\`:

``` r
output <- MSprog(toydata_visits,                                      # provide data on visits
                 subj_col='id', value_col='EDSS', date_col='date',    # specify column names
                 outcome='edss',                                      # specify outcome type
                 event='multiple', baseline='roving',                 # modify default options
                 relapse=toydata_relapses)                            # provide data on relapses
#> 
#> ---
#> Outcome: edss
#> Confirmation over: 84 days (-7 days, +730.5 days)
#> Baseline: roving
#> Baseline skipped if: <30 days from last relapse
#> Event skipped if: -
#> Confirmation visit skipped if: <30 days from last relapse
#> Events detected: multiple
#> 
#> *Please use `print(output)` to display full info on event detection criteria*
#> 
#> ---
#> Total subjects: 6
#> ---
#> Subjects with disability worsening: 4 (PIRA: 4; RAW: 1)
#> Subjects with disability improvement: 2
#> ---
#> CDW events: 5 (PIRA: 4; RAW: 1)
#> Improvement events: 2
```

The function prints out a concise report of the results, and of the
options used to obtain them. Complete results are stored in an object of
class `MSprogOutput` with the following attributes.

1.  `event_count`: a `data.frame` containing the event sequence detected
    for each subject, and the counts for each event type.

    ``` r
    print(output$event_count)
    #>   event_sequence improvement CDW RAW PIRA undefined_prog
    #> 1           PIRA           0   1   0    1              0
    #> 2      RAW, PIRA           0   2   1    1              0
    #> 3                          0   0   0    0              0
    #> 4     impr, PIRA           1   1   0    1              0
    #> 5           PIRA           0   1   0    1              0
    #> 6           impr           1   0   0    0              0
    ```

    where: `event_sequence` specifies the order of the events; the other
    columns count the events of each type.

2.  `results`: extended info on each event for all subjects.

    ``` r
    print(output$results, row.names=FALSE)
    #>  id nevent event_type total_fu time2event bl2event conf84 PIRA_conf84 sust_days
    #>   1      1       PIRA      534        292      292      1           1       242
    #>   2      1        RAW      730        198      198      1          NA        84
    #>   2      2       PIRA      730        539      257      1           1       191
    #>   3      0                 491        491       NA     NA          NA        NA
    #>   4      1       impr      586         77       77      1          NA        98
    #>   4      2       PIRA      586        304      129      1           1       282
    #>   5      1       PIRA      637        140      140      1           1       497
    #>   6      1       impr      491        120      120      1          NA       232
    #>  sust_last
    #>          1
    #>          0
    #>          1
    #>         NA
    #>          0
    #>          1
    #>          1
    #>          0
    ```

    where: `nevent` is the cumulative event count for each subject;
    `event_type` characterises the event; `time2event` is the number of
    days from start of follow-up to event; `bl2event` is the number of
    days from current baseline to event; `conf84` reports whether the
    event was confirmed over 84 days (12 weeks); `sust_days` is the
    number of days for which the event was sustained; `sust_last`
    reports whether the event was sustained until the last visit.

Additionally, applying the `print` method to an object of class
`MSprogOutput` prints out a short paragraph describing the complete set
of criteria used to obtain the output, **to be reported to ensure
complete reproducibility**:

``` r
print(output)
#> For each subject, we detected all EDSS changes (in chronological order) confirmed over 84 days (with a tolerance of 7 days on the left and 730.5 days on the right). A visit could not be used as confirmation if occurring within 30 days after the onset of a relapse. A roving baseline scheme was applied where the reference value was updated after each confirmed worsening or improvement event. The new baseline was set at the first available confirmation visit. Whenever the current baseline fell within 30 days after the onset of a relapse, , it was moved to the next available visit. A confirmed EDSS worsening event was labelled as RAW if occurring within 90 days after the onset of a relapse. A confirmed EDSS worsening event was labelled as PIRA if no relapses started in the interval from 90 days before the event to 30 days after the event, or from 90 days before confirmation to 30 days after confirmation.
