`msprog` provides tools for exhaustive and reproducible analysis of
disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) from longitudinal
data.

Its core function, `MSprog`, detects and characterises the progression
events of an outcome measure (EDSS, NHPT, T25FW, or SDMT) for one or
more subjects, based on repeated assessments through time and on the
dates of acute episodes.

The package also provides two toy datasets for function testing:

- `toydata_visits`: artificially generated EDSS and SDMT assessments for
  four patients;
- `toydata_relapses`: artificially generated relapse dates associated
  with the patients in `toydata_visits`.

Please refer to the documentation for function usage (e.g. `?MSprog`)
and data structure (e.g. `?toydata_visits`). A detailed tutorial is
available as a package vignette: ***Computing MS progression from
longitudinal data***.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `msprog` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/noemimontobbio/msprog) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("noemimontobbio/msprog", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

## Usage

`MSprog` detects the events sequentially by scanning the outcome values
in chronological order, and classifies progression events as
relapse-associated or relapse-independent based on their relative timing
with respect to the relapses
\[[1](#ref-lublin2014)–[3](#ref-silent2019)\].

Several qualitative and quantitative options for event detection are
given as arguments that can be set by the user and reported as a
complement to the results to ensure reproducibility. These include the
baseline scheme (fixed or roving), the events to be detected (first or
multiple, progression and/or improvement), the length of the relapse
influence window and of the event confirmation period(s) with the
relative tolerance.

The example below illustrates the function’s usage and outputs:

``` r
library(msprog)

# Load toy data
data(toydata_visits)
data(toydata_relapses)

# Compute progression
output <- MSprog(toydata_visits,                                   # provide data on visits
                 subj_col='id', value_col='EDSS', date_col='date', # specify column names
                 outcome='edss',                                   # specify outcome type
                 event='multiple', baseline='roving',              # modify default options on event detection
                 relapse=toydata_relapses)                         # provide data on relapses
#> 
#> ---
#> Outcome:  EDSS 
#> Confirmation at:  12 mm (- 30 dd, + 30 dd)
#> Baseline:  roving   
#> Relapse influence (baseline):  30 dd
#> Relapse influence (event):  0 dd
#> Relapse influence (confirmation):  30 dd
#> Events detected:  multiple
#> 
#> ---
#> Total subjects: 4
#> ---
#> Progressed subjects: 3 (PIRA: 3; RAW: 1)
#> Improved subjects: 1
#> ---
#> Progression events: 4 (PIRA: 3; RAW: 1)
#> Improvement events: 1
```

The function prints out a concise report of the results, as well as
**the specific set of options used to obtain them**. Complete results
are stored in two `data.frame` objects generated by the function call:

1.  A summary table providing the event count for each subject and event
    type:

    ``` r
    summary = output[[1]]
    print(summary)
    #>   event_sequence improvement progression RAW PIRA undefined_prog
    #> 1           PIRA           0           1   0    1              0
    #> 2      RAW, PIRA           0           2   1    1              0
    #> 3                          0           0   0    0              0
    #> 4     impr, PIRA           1           1   0    1              0
    ```

    where: `event_sequence` specifies the order of the events; the other
    columns count the events of each type.

2.  Extended info on each event for all subjects:

    ``` r
    results = output[[2]]
    print(results, row.names = FALSE)
    #>  id nevent event_type time2event bl2event conf12 PIRA_conf12 sust_days
    #>   1      1       PIRA        443      443      1           1        91
    #>   2      1        RAW        198      198      1          NA        84
    #>   2      2       PIRA        539      257      1           1       191
    #>   3      0                   491       NA     NA          NA        NA
    #>   4      1       impr         77       77      1          NA        98
    #>   4      2       PIRA        304      129      1           1       282
    #>  sust_last
    #>          1
    #>          0
    #>          1
    #>         NA
    #>          0
    #>          1
    ```

    where: `nevent` is the cumulative event count for each subject;
    `event_type` characterises the event; `time2event` is the number of
    days from start of follow-up to event; `bl2event` is the number of
    days from current baseline to event; `conf12` reports whether the
    event was confirmed at 12 weeks; `sust_days` is the number of days
    for which the event was sustained; `sust_last` reports whether the
    event was sustained until the last visit.
